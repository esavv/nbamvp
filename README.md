# NBA MVP Predictions

## Overview

This application predicts the [NBA MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player) on a weekly basis as the NBA season progresses and emails its predictions to users. For each active player, the app predicts how many MVP votes they'll receive at the end of the season.

---

## Scripts

- `predict_mvp.py`: Main entrypoint and coordinates all other scripts. Runs weekly.  
- `generate_data.py`: Pulls the latest NBA stats using the `basketball_reference_web_scraper` package.
- `mvp_model.py`: Trains the ML models used to make predictions.  
- `preprocess_data.py`: Prepares the data for model training.  
- `nba_email.py`: Emails results to users.

## Admin Documentation

### Running the Application

1. **Add Last Season's Voting Results**:
   - Navigate to the following URL:  
     `https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_YYYY.html#mvp`  
   - Replace `YYYY` with the last season's end year. Example: [2024 MVP Results](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2024.html#mvp)
   - Use "Share & Export" â†’ "Get table as CSV (for Excel)" to download the data.  
   - Save it as `/data/mvp_results/results_YYYY.csv`.  
   - TODO: Automate this.

2. **Update the Season Schedule**:
   - Modify the following lines in `predict_mvp.py`:  
     ```python  
     season_start = date(2022, 10, 19)  # UPDATE!  
     season_end   = date(2023, 4, 9)    # UPDATE!  
     ```  
   - Get season start and end dates from Wikipedia. Example: [2022-2023 NBA Season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022-23_NBA_season).
   - TODO: Automate this.

3. **Dev Mode**:  
   - To run the application in dev mode:
     ```bash  
     python3 predict_mvp --mode 'dev'  
     ```
   - Dev mode trains a weaker model, saves results as dev files instead of prod files, and emails results to admin users.

### AWS Management

1. **Enable SSH Access for an EC2 Instance**:  
   - After creating an EC2 keypair and having it auto-downloaded, run this command locally:
     ```bash  
     ssh-keygen -y -f your_key.pem
     ```
   - Copy the output of that command and log into your instance via EC2 Instance Connect (via the EC2 web console)
   - Once logged into your instance, open `.ssh/authorized_keys` & paste the output you copied into the first line of the file (above any pre-existing content)

2. **SSH into an EC2 Instance**:  
   - Run this command locally:
     ```bash  
     ssh -i "nbamvp_ec2.pem" root@ec2-3-230-84-20.compute-1.amazonaws.com
     ```

3. **Navigate Project Files in EC2 Instance**:  
   - How to view my source code:
     ```bash  
     cd /var/app/current
     ```
   - How to view my cronjobs:
     ```bash  
     vi /etc/cron.d/mycron
     ```
   - How to view my cronjob logs:
     ```bash  
     vi /var/log/dev_job.log
     vi /var/log/prod_job.log
     ```

4. **Prepare Source Code for AWS Beanstalk Deployment**:  
   - How to manually zip my source for beanstalk deployment:
     ```bash  
     zip -r nbamvp_20241025_01.zip .ebextensions/ data/adv_stats/ data/email/ data/mvp_predictions/2025/predictions* data/mvp_results/ data/per_game_stats/ data standings/ data/stats/ src/ static/ crontab.txt Procfile readme.txt requirements.txt webapp.py
     ```
   - Note: Update "data/mvp_predictions/2025/predictions*" for the current NBA season year

5. **Upgrade Dependencies on EC2 Instance**:  
   - When redeploying to AWS, you may need to manually reinstall / upgrade basketball_reference_web_scraper on the EC2 instance.
   - After logging in, run something like:
     ```bash  
     pip install --upgrade basketball_reference_web_scraper
     ```
   - To test it on EB, be sure to use python3.11 and not python3.
   - TODO: Try including the package in requirements.txt and see if EB installs it correctly

6. **Copy AWS Results Back to Local**:  
   - Before deploying updated source code to AWS we need to ensure our local codebase has the lastest predictions from the existing deployment.
   - To copy AWS predictions back to local directory, run this locally:
     ```bash  
     scp -i "nbamvp_ec2.pem" root@ec2-3-230-84-20.compute-1.amazonaws.com:'/var/app/current/data/mvp_predictions/2025/predictions_2025_wk05*' data/mvp_predictions/2025/
     ```
   - Note: In the command above, update the source pattern ('...2024_wk23*') to target the right files
